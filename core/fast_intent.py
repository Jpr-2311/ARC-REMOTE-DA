"""
Fast Intent Engine — embedding-based intent classification.

Replaces the static INSTANT_CACHE with a semantic similarity engine.
Uses sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings.
Runs in ~5-15ms on CPU. No LLM call needed.

Pipeline:
    normalized_text → embed → cosine_similarity(all_intents) → best_match
